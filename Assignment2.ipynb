      "['this paper, we will describe a simple rule-based approach to automated learning of linguistic knowledge. This approach has been shown for a number of tasks to capture information in a clearer and more direct fashion without a compromise in performance. We present a detailed case study of this learning method applied to part of speech tagging', 'The paper summarizes the essential properties of document retrieval and reviews both conventional practice and research findings, the latter suggesting that simple statistical techniques can be effective. It then considers the new opportunities and challenges presented by the ability to search full text directly (rather than e.g. titles and abstracts), and suggests appropriate approaches to doing this, with a focus on the role of natural language processing. The paper also comments on possible connections with data and knowledge retrieval, and concludes by emphasizing the importance of rigorous performance testing. This paper will appear in Communications of the ACM. 2 Introduction Automatic text, or document, retrieval has recently become a topic of interest for those working in natural language processing (NLP). The aim of this article is to indicate the key properties of document retrieval, distinguishing it from both data retrieval and question answering; to summarize past exper...', 'This paper focuses on connectionist models in natural language processing. We briefly present and discuss several aspects of high level tasks which recently have been approached with connectionism, either with localist or parallel distributed processing models. Several interesting architectures have been proposed in the last decade, and connectionist natural language processing seems like a promising area for future research in artificial intelligence. 1. Introduction  The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being approached in several different ways. Most NLP systems so far have been implemented with a symbolic approach, which is the more \"traditional\" approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI). After the revival of connectionism in the 1980s, when Rumelhart & McClelland[20] demonstrated that it was possible to get around the limitations which Minsky & Papert[15] pointed out in the 1960s, papers on connectionist approaches to NLP started to appear. Currently, it is well known ...', 'Abstract: The article explores the possibility to construct a unified word feature out of the component features of letters. Each letter is modeled by a different attractor and finally embedded in a quadratic iterated map. The result is the word feature that can account for the meaning extraction process of language understanding. This is a new approach in natural language processing based on the deterministic chaotic behavior of dynamical systems. 1', 'We propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.', \"this paper (see [Schank 86] for a theoretical discussion and [Kass 86] and [Leake and Owens 86] for brief discussions of a program built around these .principles); the goal here is simply  to point out how our interest in natural language processing has led us naturally, and indeed inevitably, to develop theories of explanation and creativity. Some may say that we have strayed from the core issues of NLP, but our point is that these are the core issues. The drive to eplain what might be 'going on in the stow guides the entire understanding process\", 'Objectives To provide an overview and tutorial of natural language processing (NLP) and modern NLP-system design. Target audience This tutorial targets the medical informatics generalist who has limited acquaintance with the principles behind NLP and/or limited knowledge of the current state of the art. Scope We describe the historical evolution of NLP, and summarize common NLP sub-problems in this extensive field. We then provide a synopsis of selected highlights of medical NLP efforts. After providing a brief description of common machine-learning approaches that are being used for diverse NLP sub-problems, we discuss how modern NLP architectures are designed, with a summary of the Apache Foundation’s Unstructured Information Management Architecture. We finally consider possible future directions for NLP, and reflect on the possible impact of IBM Watson on the medical field.', 'This paper briefly describes the current implementation status of an intelligent information retrieval system, MARIE, that employs natural language processing techniques. Descriptive captions are used to iden- tify photographic images concerning various military projects. The captions are parsed to produce a logical form from which nouns and verbs are extracted to form the primary keywords. User queries are also specified in natural language. A two-phase search process employing coarse-grain and fine-grain match processes is used to find the captions that best match the query. A type hierarchy based on object-oriented programming constructs is used to represent the semantic knowledge base. This knowledge base contains knowledge of various military concepts and terminology with specifics from the Naval Weapons Center. Methods are used for creating the logical form during semantic analysis, generating the keywords to be used in the coarse-grain match process, and fine-grain matching between query and caption logical forms.', 'Abstract: Metabolism is the machinery of life and signal transduction provides the regulatory mechanisms to control that machinery. Due to the complexity of signal transduction pathways, computational approaches are needed to aid the biologist in integrating available knowledge and in the formulation of testable hypotheses. Our objective is to apply multi-agent systems to build a comprehensive system for study of signal transduction. The agent driven system draws inferences and hypothesizes pathways, evaluates predictions and identifies information relevant to signal transduction from both web based and literature resources. We describe here a system for agent directed natural language processing to extract information from journal articles. An interface was developed to permit curation of the NLP results and deposition of accepted results into a knowledge base. Motivation: The advent of high-throughput methods has revolutionized the field of biology, creating an information explosion in their wake. The daily accretion of experimental data from sequencing projects, scientific literature, gene array experiments and other high volume data pipelines, has prompted calls (Karp, 2001) to encode', 'Web has emerged as the most important source of information in the world. This has resulted in need for automated software components to analyze web pages and harvest useful information from them. However, in typical web pages the informative content is surrounded by a very high degree of noise in the form of advertisements, navigation bars, links to other content, etc. Often the noisy content is interspersed with the main content leaving no clean boundaries between them. This noisy content makes the problem of information harvesting from web pages much harder. Therefore, it is essential to be able to identify main content of a web page and automatically isolate it from noisy content for any further analysis. Most existing approaches rely on prior knowledge of website specific templates and hand-crafted rules specific to websites for extraction of relevant content. We propose a generic approach that does not require prior knowledge of website templates. While HTML DOM analysis and visual layout analysis approaches have sometimes been used, we believe that for higher accuracy in content extraction, the analyzing software needs to mimic a human user and under- stand content in natural language similar to the way humans intuitively do in order to eliminate noisy content. In this paper, we describe a combination of HTML DOM analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated extractions of main article with associated images from web pages.']\n",
