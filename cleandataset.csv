3,"Introduction  Statistical natural language processing (SNLP)    is a field lying in the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning. SNLP differs from traditional natural language processing in that instead of having a linguist manually construct some model of a given linguistic phenomenon, that model is instead (semi-) automatically constructed from linguistically annotated resources. Methods for assigning partof -speech tags to words, categories to texts, parse trees to sentences, and so on, are (semi-) automatically acquired using machine learning techniques.  The recent trend of applying statistical techniques to natural language processing came largely from industrial speech recognition research groups at AT&T's Bell Laboratories and IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center. Statistical techniques in speech recognition have so vastly outstripped the performance of their non-statistical counterparts.",Positive

NLP is focussed on the area of human computer interaction. The need for natural language processing was also felt because there is a wide storage of information recorded or stored in natural language that could be accessible via computers. Information is constantly generated in the form of books, news, business and government reports, and scientific papers, many of which are available online or even in some reports. A system requiring a great deal of information must be able to process natural language to retrieve much of the information available on computers. Natural language processing is an interesting and difficult field in which we have to develop and evaluate or analyse representation and reasoning theories.

In the narrower sense, it covers the syntactic and semantic processing sentences to deliver semantic objects suitable for referring, inferring, and the like. Of course, the results of inference and reference may under some circumstances play a part in processing in the narrow sense.

18,"Web has emerged as the most important source of information in the world. This has resulted in need for automated software components to analyze web pages and harvest useful information from them. However, in typical web pages the informative content is surrounded by a very high degree of noise in the form of advertisements, navigation bars, links to other content, etc. Often the noisy content is interspersed with the main content leaving no clean boundaries between them. This noisy content makes the problem of information harvesting from web pages much harder. Therefore, it is essential to be able to identify main content of a web page and automatically isolate it from noisy content for any further analysis. Most existing approaches rely on prior knowledge of website specific templates and hand-crafted rules specific to websites for extraction of relevant content. We propose a generic approach that does not require prior knowledge of website templates. While HTML DOM analysis and visual layout analysis approaches have sometimes been used, we believe that for higher accuracy in content extraction, the analyzing software needs to mimic a human user and under- stand content in natural language similar to the way humans intuitively do in order to eliminate noisy content.

Therefore, to understand the nature of natural language, we need a sophisticated treatment of the basic elements as well as the insights about how these elements will be structured.

Since the basic property of these elements is considered common over the whole corpora, we need to model their distributional property over the corpora by a statistical learning approach.

Along these two units, I propose novel treatments of distributional units that are dierent from the methods used in natural language processing so far. In Chapter 2, I consider static units.

The objectives are the improvement of adaptability of information extraction systems to new thematic do-mains (or even languages), and the improvement of their performance using as fewer resources (either linguistic or human) as possible. This thesis has examined two main axes: a) the research and assessment of existing algorithms of machine learning mainly in the stages of linguistic pre-processing (such as part of speech tagging) and named-entity recog-nition, and b) the creation of a new machine learning algorithm and its assessment on synthetic data, as well as in real world data for the task of relation extraction between named entities. This new algorithm belongs to the category of inductive grammar learning, and can infer context free grammars from only positive examples.",Positive
55,"Probabilistic finite-state string transducers (FSTs) are extremely popular in natural language processing, due to powerful generic methods for applying, composing, and learning them. Unfortunately, FSTs are not a good fit for much of the current work on probabilistic modeling for machine translation, summarization, paraphrasing, and language modeling. These methods operate directly on trees, rather than strings. We show that tree acceptors and tree transducers subsume most of this work, and we discuss algorithms for realizing the same benefits found in probabilistic string transduction. ",Negative

57,"We propose a bifurcated paradigm for the construction of a Prolog knowl-edge base from a body of documents: first, an information extraction (IE) application that will annotate the corpus and output the annotated documents, and second, a Prolog knowledge base (KB) application that will transform the annotated documents into a KB (a set of facts). The General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) was used as the platform for the development and execution of the IE application, which in-cluded most components of A Nearly New Information Extraction (ANNIE) system. Apart from the basic IE capabilities of ANNIE, the application fea-tured additional high-level annotation grammars written in the Java Annota-tion Patterns Engine (JAPE) language and a trainable annotator that used the maximum entropy machine learning model, which were designed to annotate several biographies of well-known mathematicians. The Prolog KB applica-tion, programmed to be executed within the XSB System, was designed to receive the annotated text output by the IE application and produce a knowl-edge base, and it successfully creates a database of Prolog facts that can be intelligently queried through the XSB System. The KB utilizes the frame representation of facts, specifically by treating one document as an object to be represented as a frame, with each annotation type treated as a slot whose multiple values are whichever specific strings were annotated by the IE appli-cation. This transformation of extracted information into Prolog facts forms a link between IE, a recent development in Natural Language Processing, and logic programming with Prolog.",Neutral

The system processes short English narratives and is able to acquire, from a single narrative, a new schema for a stereotypical set of actions. During the understanding process, the system attempts to construct explanations for characters ' actions in terms of the goals their actions were meant to achieve. When the system observes that a character has achieved an interesting goal in a novel way, it generalizes the set of actions they used to achieve this goal into a new schema. The generalization process is a knowledge-based analysis of the causal structure of the narrative which removes unnecessary details while maintaining the validity of the causal explanation. The resulting generalized set of actions is then stored as a new schema and used by the system to correctly process narratives which were previously beyond its capabilities.",Positive

64,"Previous work demonstrated that Web counts can be used to approximate bigram counts, suggesting that Web-based frequencies should be useful for a wide variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, only a limited number of tasks have so far been tested using Web-scale data sets. The present article overcomes this limitation by systematically investigating the performance of Web-based models for several NLP tasks, covering both syntax and semantics, both generation and analysis, and a wider range of n-grams and parts of speech than have been previously explored. For the majority of our tasks, we find that simple, unsupervised models perform better when n-gram counts are obtained from the Web rather than from a large corpus. In some cases, performance can be improved further by using backoff or interpolation techniques that combine Web counts and corpus counts. However, unsupervised Web-based models generally fail to outperform supervised state-ofthe-art models trained on smaller corpora. We argue that Web-based models should therefore be used as a baseline for, rather than an alternative to, standard supervised models.",Positive

Word category maps are SOMs that have been organized according to word similarities, measured by the similarity of the short contexts of the words.

Although no a priori information about classes is given, during the self-organizing process a model of the word classes emerges. The central topic of the thesis is the use of the SOM in natural language processing. The approach based on the word category maps is compared with the methods that are widely used in artificial intelligence research.
